# `@guardian/types`

⚠️ **DEPRECATED**

_Guardian-specific TypeScript types have been migrated to [@guardian/libs](https://github.com/guardian/libs)._

_`Option`/`Result` are still available in v9 of this package to accommodate existing usage, but v9 will be the last version of this package._

_If continued development is needed on them, [they should be maintained and published elsewhere](https://github.com/guardian/types/issues/5#issuecomment-610876533)._
