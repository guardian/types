# `@guardian/types`

### ⚠️ DEPRECATED

_tl;dr_ use [@guardian/libs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/libs).

#### What is left here?

- Guardian business TypeScript types have been migrated to [@guardian/libs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/libs).
- A TypeScript implementation of `Option`/`Result` is still available in v9.0.1 of this package, to accommodate existing usage, but that will be the final release. If further development is needed on them, [they should be maintained and published elsewhere](https://github.com/guardian/types/issues/5#issuecomment-610876533).
